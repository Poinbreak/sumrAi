    "Behold! An authentic Chicken Biryani recipe with simple, easy-to-follow instructions (no curveballs!) and mouthwatering, traditional Pakistani and Indian flavor. This recipe includes tips on how to get fluffy rice, tender chicken, and the distinct biryani taste. Tested to perfection!",
    "“I have tried several biryani recipes, none come near this one. Thank you for sharing this gem!”",
    "It took me absolutely no effort to bring you this biryani recipe. All I had to do was find the best biryani in Houston, dissect it, hound poor Rizwan for details, perform 10+ trials, use the concepts in Salt Acid Fat Heat to further perfect it, survey my email list for preferences, interpolate to figure out spice quantities, and you know…cry a little.",
    "In short, I literally ate, slept, and breathed biryani until I could proudly publish this most-beloved, highly requested recipe and do it justice. Phew. Let’s do this.",
    "More Famous Chicken Recipes: Butter Chicken, Chicken Jalfrezi, and Chicken Karahi",
    "I’ve intentionally chosen the ingredients and quantities to give this biryani a strong foundation. That said, this recipe can take quite a bit of substitutions and adaptations and still be excellent.",
    "I believe this recipe is as easy as an authentic biryani recipe can be – no superfluous or tedious steps that don’t contribute to big flavor. You’ll find that while it takes time, most of it is passive cooking time. And the end result is quite rewarding and impressive. These are 3 main parts to making chicken biryani:",
    "Pakistani biryani is heavy on spice (and flavor!), and is often made with biryani masala, or simply put, a medley of spices that come together to give it a distinct, masaledar (or spice-laden) taste.",
    "I recommend you use the biryani masala recipe below (all you need is a good spice grinder and a few extra whole spices). If you’d prefer not to, you can substitute your favorite store-bought biryani masala. This recipe has been tested and works great with Bombay Biryani Masala.",
    "To make Biryani masala for this recipe, combine the following ingredients in a spice grinder and process until mostly smooth. Makes ~2 tbsp, which is the exact quantity you’ll need for this recipe.",
    "Note: You don’t have to have every single one of these spices to make a wonderful biryani. Don’t worry if you’re missing some – it’ll still give your biryani exceptional flavor!",
    "There are 3 components that make the chicken tender and deeply flavored:",
    "Identifying doneness can be confusing, so I’ve simplified it by giving time parameters to take the guesswork out of boiling.",
    "If you’re using the recommended aged, long-grain basmati rice, you’ll need to boil for 5 minutes. If you’re using newly harvested basmati rice often found in American grocery stores, it’ll require a shorter boiling time (around 4 minutes).",
    "For reference, here’s how my rice acts minute-to-minute:",
    "Tip: Drain the rice promptly so the hot water doesn’t continue cooking the rice.",
    "Also note that a little overcooked or undercooked rice is not going to ruin your biryani. ",
    "Determining the right ratio of rice to meat can be tricky. I figured the best way to break this down is with this table:",
    "Note that these are my preferred ratios. Feel free to increase the rice by 1/4 cup if you prefer more rice and less chicken.",
    "A whooping 52% of my email community found getting the taste right to be the most difficult part of making biryani. Here’s what I’ve found:",
    "I’ve found Rizwan’s statement to be true. When steam permeates through the rice, spices, herbs, and chicken, it infuses the biryani with so much flavor that each bite is a treat.",
    "Though you can use any pot or pan you’d like to prepare the chicken and parboil the rice, a Dutch oven or deep pot (at least 5 qt) will be helpful for the steaming (‘dum’) stage.",
    "Unless you’re making larger quantities, don’t worry about buying a special pot for biryani. I’ve tried using a cheap dutch oven with a tava underneath and a cast iron dutch oven and both worked well. Here are a few tips:",
    "(Update: 8/29/24) I’ve often been asked how to steam biryani in the oven. I prefer a longer steam at lower heat to a shorter steam at higher heat. To steam in the oven:",
    "If you’re in a rush, you can steam at 300°F-320°F (150°C-160°C) for 30 minutes. ",
    "I’ve kept the layering simple, but you can make it as festive as you’d like by adding sliced tomatoes, store-bought/homemade fried onions, or green chili peppers in between or on top of the chicken and rice.",
    "I’ve tested this recipe several times with double the quantity. Here’s what’ll change:",
    "Tip: To double the recipe within the recipe card, hover to top right of the ingredients and adjust the recipe by clicking 2x. This will adjust the all the ingredient quantities for you.",
    "Potatoes in biryani are a point of contention, with responses ranging from “Is it even biryani if it doesn’t have potatoes?” to “With potatoes, it’s pulao.” ",
    "Since I don’t have a strong preference, I thought it’s best for me to explain how to add them and then leave it up to you.",
    "Countless readers have reported success using boneless chicken, lamb, goat, beef, and more. Lamb or goat will require 2 hours to cook, and to compensate for the longer cook time, you’ll need to add more water. If using boneless chicken, add 1/4 cup water instead of 1/2 and cook for 15 minutes. See FAQs for a general cook time table.",
    "Biryani is a stand-alone dish, and a simple or Vegetable Raita or Mint Raita will be enough alongside it. Kachumber Salad or fresh, crunchy vegetables such as sliced onions, carrots, or cucumbers will add crunch and texture. ",
    "If you’re serving it for guests, kebabs like Aloo Tikki (Potato Cakes), Chapli Kabab, or Shami Kebab would pair well.",

    "Loved this recipe. I have tried it twice now and it tastes amazing. I just halved the whole spices the second time as it felt like too much work to separate it while eating. It did not impact the taste at all!",
    "That’s great feedback Sehrish! The biryani that inspired it was very heavy on the whole spices so I kept that way but they’re certainly adjustable. Thanks for taking the time to share!",
    "I love this recipe and have made it several times with both chicken and goat over the last few years.\nThis brings me to my question, I’m hosting 20 people and don’t have time to cook goat (making with goat) over the stove. So, can I pressure cook the meat in an instant pot (similarly to you aloo gosht recipe)? If so, any idea how much water to add? Thanks in advance for the reply. ",

    "Biryani is a celebration of all that is great about Indian food – the heady aromas, the vibrant colours, the fluffy rice and those addictive curry flavours. Make this Chicken Biryani with your protein of choice – or try a vegetable biryani!",
    "",
    "One of the most requested recipes is finally here! Another RecipeTin Family effort, it took us seven attempts to get this biryani right.",
    "Seven attempts means seven heated arguments about who would take the leftover biryani because somebody in the RecipeTin family, at any point in time, usually declares themselves to be on a diet to address blog-related weight gain concerns.",
    "And it was worth it. (Belly and all.) Biryani, we can’t get enough of you!",
    "Essentially, it’s your favourite chicken curry (or vegetable or other protein of choice) buried under a mound of delicately spiced fluffy rice, all made in one pot. The rice is steamed over a low heat so it absorbs the flavours of the curry bubbling away underneath.",
    "So in a nutshell, it’s every curry loving-carb monsters’ dream come true. It’s got my name written all over it!",
    "You’ll find variations of Biryani all across the Indian subcontinent, from Pakistan to Bangladesh, Afghanistan to India. There are 2 main types – one where the protein and/or vegetables are cooked mixed throughout the rice, and the other version known as Hyderabad-style biryani in India where meat and rice are layered and cook in a sealed pot over fire. The latter is the style of biryani I’m sharing today.",
    "There’s a wonderful Afghani restaurant in my area called Sahar (Newport, Sydney) which serves a Biryani that’s a huge favourite among locals. Hands down, the best ethnic restaurant I know in the upper northern beaches.",
    "Chicken marinated in a spiced yoghurt is placed in a large pot, then layered with fried onions (cheeky easy sub below!), fresh coriander/cilantro, then par boiled lightly spiced rice.",
    "The crowning glory is to finish it off with a drizzle of saffron infused water to give it the signature patches of bright yellow rice, as well as ghee (or melted butter) for buttery richness.",
    "The pot is then covered and cooked over a low heat for about 25 minutes during which time the rice absorbs the aromas and flavours of the curry underneath, whilst still being beautifully fluffy.",
    "",
    "That moment when you lift the lid and are greeted with this sight…",
    "",
    "…. that moment is only second to this: when you dig deep into the pot, ensuring you get some of every layer, and the full force of the aroma from the curry buried deep under the rice hits you, and it takes every single bit of will power to gravitate that spoon towards a bowl instead of attempting to shove that entire giant scoop in your mouth….",
    "",
    "OK wait. Did you almost lose control too?",
    "I’m almost done. Bear with me – just want to show you a few more things before handing over the recipe!",
    "There’s subtle flavourings used for the rice, and a load more used for the curry sauce.",
    "There’s a lengthy list but there’s nothing exotic here, you can find all these spices at everyday supermarkets here in Australia. Some recipes call for Asafoetida which is an Indian spice that requires a trip to an Indian grocer. We tried it with and without, and I swear we could not taste a difference. So we don’t use it. 🙂",
    "Thin slices of onion fried until sweet and a bit crispy, this is used as one of the layers in the Biryani as well as a garnish for serving.",
    "If you aren’t a fan of deep frying or are a beginner cook, my cheeky alternative is using store bought fried onion (Asian or Indian stores) or Asian Fried Shallots (pictured below) which are sold at everyday supermarkets. They add the same oniony flavour with the added bonus of extra crunch!",
    "Another recipe ticked off the Recipe Request list, another RecipeTin family effort!!",
    "As always, we love to look to the pros to build a starting point for recipe inspiration. We ate biryani at our favourite specialty restaurants in Sydney, Pakistani chain Student Biryani in Auburn, and the Indian restaurant Paradise Biryani House in North Strathfield.",
    "To learn the techniques, we looked at a few books (love the local library!), dozens of internet pages and Youtube videos from home cooks in India.",
    "Yes the ingredients list is long – but you’ll find everything at the supermarket. And while there are a number of steps to make Biryani, it is actually quite a straightforward recipe. (Video is helpful too!)",
    "And even if yours doesn’t turn out perfect, don’t be put off because even less than perfect biryani is still delicious (we happily scoffed the first few test batches despite the flaws!). – Nagi x",

I was a little bit unsure as it how it would go when increasing it to such a large volume. But it was absolutely incredible. So so many compliments at my dinner parties. Thank you Nagi. It really is a great recipe. I usually marinate the chicken the night before. I just use chicken thigh without the bone. I did it with the bone once and the flavour was the same. I just find it easier to cook without the bone. I highly recommend xxx",
